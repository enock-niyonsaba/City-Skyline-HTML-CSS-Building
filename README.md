# City Skyline with CSS and HTML

This project is a city skyline simulation created using HTML and CSS. The buildings, windows, and sky are designed to change in response to screen size, simulating a transition between day and night. The sky background uses a radial gradient to represent the sun and moon, and each building features different color schemes and window styles.

## Sample Images

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The city skyline adjusts between day and night modes when resizing the screen.
- **Customizable Colors**: Easily change the look of buildings and windows by adjusting CSS variables.
- **Gradients & Patterns**: The buildings use repeating linear gradients to simulate windows and facades.
- **Layered Design**: The buildings are placed in the background and foreground layers for added depth.
